In this file you should include:

Any information you think we should know about your submission
* Is there anything that doesn't work? Why?
We weren't really able to edit the tree because we weren't really able to store and update a very complex data structure that is the family tree into the firebase. We had every function implemented locally as you can see in the commits. All editing buttons will cause crashes. We worked very hard on the code, but storing it in firebase really just held us back.
* Is there anything that you did that you feel might be unclear? Explain it here.
N/A
